                <div class ="text-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we explain that two words are related to each other? For an explanation about a word which has a connection with another word, we need a specific standard. So in this project, we have divided every sentences in the book which is ‚ÄúThe Ethics of Information‚Äù by a specific interval for recognition of word association. This specific interval is called, ‚Äòwindow‚Äô.
                <br/><br/> 
                I love cats.<br/> 
                Cats are the most adorable creatures in the world.<br/> 
                But cats mostly don't like me.<br/> 
                <br/> 
                Here are three example sentences. First, it is divided into three sentences according to the period(.). When we consider that there are three windows, in the first sentence, which is ‚ÄúI love cats‚Äù has three words is related each other. The second sentence is divided into three words. For instance, cat is the / is the most / the most adorable / most adorable creatures e.t.c. As a result, three words in a row in this way are considered to be related to each other. 
                <br/></br/>
            
                2. What does the size of nodes mean?</strong><br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;So, are all the words connected with each other eventually? Yes, right. However, it may be different because of the number of times ‚Äòlove‚Äô and ‚Äòcats‚Äô are connected, and the number of times ‚Äòlove‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äô are connected. Therefore, we used a specific process which is ‚Äòtextrank‚Äô to calculate the importance and degree of connection for each word using the number of times. The word which appears the most will be the most important and the two words will be more connected if the frequency of occurrence of two specific words together is high. When managing words, the frequency of their appearance is important. Therefore, the more it appears, the larger the node size, and vice versa. Also, the 100 words selected in the graph were also selected from 100 words with high importance according to their frequency of appearance.
