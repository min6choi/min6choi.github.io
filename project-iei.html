                      is a philosophy data society to help the understanding of philosophical texts. 
                      The main purpose of this project is to help people who are new to a certain 
                      philosophy book have a basic understanding of the content of the book. Many 
                      philosophical books cannot predict the content of a book from its title or 
                      table of contents. And it is expected that these difficulties will be seen in 
                      many other academic books as well. So, we organized the project to classify the 
                      entire text of a specific book(we use â€˜The Ethics  of Informationâ€™ by Luciano 
                      Floridi this time) of with Louvain's algorithm and see the associations between words at a glance.
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      &nbsp;As a student who has studied this book in class, I personally could not easily understand 
                      the new definitions of the words by the author of the book or the connections between words and 
                      words. So, first, we visually display important words in the book according to the size of the 
                      circle which we call node, and make the first sentence where each word is located appear when 
                      the node is clicked so that the use of  words in the book can be accessed more directly.
