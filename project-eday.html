                    <div class ="text-content">&nbsp;The project E-day is based on the 13th climate change response 
                      of the DSC Korea Solution Challenge Hackathon 2021. In this project, we focused on the fact that
                      climate change is an invisible but important issue for us. So we wanted to present specific 
                      figures compared to the current temperature with a visible data to see the climate change directly.
                      We have tried to help people understand intuitively by visualizing data on rising temperatures and
                      increasing greenhouse gases caused by global warming. This idea is founded from a coronavirus which
                      is invisible but is revealed by visual charts. 
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      &nbsp;We used HTML, CSS, JS, weather API, and tensorflow for this project. First, using D3.js(a JavaScript 
                      library for data visualization), we created a dynamic and interactive line chart of past data. In addition,
                      by using the weather API to receive the current location and temperature and compare in real time with the
                      average monthly temperature in 1973 of South Korea which got from the Korea Meteorological Administration,
                      it was attempted to show the temperature rise due to global warming more intuitively. Finally, a temperature
                      prediction model was created using machine learning TensorFlow. We tried to predict the average monthly 
                      temperature after 2021 using the LSTM algorithm, which is widely used for prediction and analysis of time
                      series data arranged at regular time intervals.
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      &nbsp;The most interesting thing about this project is that when you access the now(ì§€ê¸ˆ) page, you can visually
                      compare the 1973 temperature in your city with the current temperature in real time to see how much the temperature
                      has risen compared to the past <a style=color:#309C98>(Currently only check the temperature of South Korea on Feb)</a>.
                      Even if the temperature value is added or there is data other than the temperature, only the initial data file needs to be changed, so
                      the prediction model is easy to reuse, and anyone can easily identify the difference while comparing the real-time
                      temperature with the historical average temperature through the API. We only used the data of South korea in this
                      project, but it also can be used overseas data. If this idea is widely used, we can easily and effectively present
                      the necessity of responding to environmental changes and  this will have a positive impact on solving environmental
                      problems we have.
